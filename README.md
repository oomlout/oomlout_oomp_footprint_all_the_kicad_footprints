# oomlout_oomp_footprint_all_the_kicad_footprints
We're working on taxonomizing electronics through a project called oomp (oopen organization method of parts). 

This is one of the generated results, it's all the kicad footprint libraries we can find put into a single directory with the names changed to reflect the owner of the library and the footprint name.

This uses the amazing collection of all the known kicad footprint repos put together by kitspace.

Also mvnmgrk's amazing kiutils

Definietly a work in progress, but if you want a lot of footprints all imported quickly (our kicad takes about 5 minutes to load them then runs smoothly) this is the answer.
